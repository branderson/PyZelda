    Fixed drawing stage of engine, so that game objects don't scale, coordinate surfaces scale during blit
Dec. 23
    Fixed states and other objects sharing properties between members of a class
    Worked on getting the documentation up to date.
    Small tweaks to engine and consistency improvements.
Dec. 22
    Fixed rotation bug when changing screen size
    Added collision detection!
    Added states
    Added collision rects for game objects
    Added functions for updating and drawing all scenes in a state
    Added radial movement for game objects
Dec. 21
    Added GameObject visibility toggle
    Added absolute movement for views
    Added rotation about center for objects
    Added flip, surprisingly difficult with rotation correction
    Added center view on object
    Added animation but not yet tested
Dec. 20
    Fixed objects not being drawn when moved too far, was checking rect which doesn't change instead of check_position()
    Layers added
    Tinting added
    Objects can have multiple stored images, stored in dictionary
    Views stored in dictionary instead of list
    Resource dictionaries added, only handle sprites so far
Dec. 19
    Views no longer own objects
    Scale rects are now only calculated on draw and not stored
    Multiple views can be owned by a scene and on screen at once!
    Masks work!!!
        Fixed masks so objects are drawn if they have at least one of the masks, rather than all of them
Up to Dec. 17
    Clock implemented
    CoordinateSurface implemented
        Coordinate surface holds lists of pointers to objects
        Able to resize to any screen resolution
            Even on the fly!
    GameObject implemented
    Spritesheet implemented
