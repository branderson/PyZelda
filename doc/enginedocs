    gameclock.py
        GameClock(ticks_per_second=25, max_fps=0, use_wait=True, max_frame_skip=5,
        update_callback=None, frame_callback=None, time_source=None)

        Manage time in the following ways:

        1. Run game engine at a constant speed, independent of variable frame rate.
        2. Schedule items to coincide with tick(), update_ready, frame_ready, and
           elapsed intervals.
        3. Employ on-demand time dilation.

        In functions, program what should happen in one second and divide by TICKS_PER_SECOND

        Parameters:
            ticks_per_second -> Positive integer. Constant ticks per second for
                game physics.
            max_fps -> Positive integer. Max frames allowed per second. A value of
                zero allows unlimited frames.
            use_wait -> Boolean. When True, GameClock.tick() uses time.sleep to
                throttle frames per second. This uses less CPU at the postential
                cost of smoothness. When False, GameClock.tick() returns without
                injecting any waits, and can result in smoother frames.
            max_frame_skip -> Positive integer. Max game ticks allowed before
                forcing a frame display.
            update_callback -> Callable. Special callback to invoke when update is
                ready.
            frame_callback -> Callable. Special callback to invoke when frame is
                ready.
            time_source -> Callable. Custom time source, e.g.
                lambda:pygame.time.get_ticks() / 1000.0.
        Properties:
            interpolate -> Read-only. Float (range 0 to 1) factor representing the
                exact point in time between the previous and next ticks.
            update_ready -> Read-only. Boolean indicating it is time to update the
                game logic.
            frame_ready -> Read-only. Boolean indicating it is time to update the
                display.
            dilation -> Read-write. Set the time dilation factor. Normal==1.0,
                Slower>1.0, Faster<1.0. Affects DT and interval timers.
            update_callback -> Read-write. The callback function to invoke at each
                update_ready interval.
            frame_callback -> Read-write. The callback function to invoke at each
                frame_ready interval.
            fps, frame_count, frame_elapsed -> Read-only. Most recent FPS,
                cumulative frames posted during the current second, and time elapsed
                in the previous frame, respectively.
            ups, update_count, update_elapsed -> Read-only. Most recent updates per
                second, cumulative updates posted during the current second, and
                time elapsed in the previous update, respectively.
            tps -> Read-only. Most recently measured tick() calls per second.
            time -> Read-write. The value from the last poll of time source.
            ticks_per_second -> Read-write. See parameter ticks_per_second.
            max_fps -> Read-write. See parameter max_fps.
            use_wait -> Read-write. See parameter use_wait.
            max_frame_skip -> Read-write. See parameter max_frame_skip.
        Methods:
            tick() -> Game loop timer. Call once per game loop.
            get_time() -> Return the milliseconds elapsed in the previous call to tick().
