Implement state
    Save and load
        Look into serialization
    Might want to change scenes to list instead of dict for draw order
CoordinateSurface
    Append remove_object so that it can remove one at position or remove all at position
    Consider integrating insert_object_centered as a flag into insert_object
    A large portion of this might be unnecessary (I may have been able to use subsurfaces)
    Need to change tint functionality in coordinate surface to save to return a new surface, like game_objects do
    Don't use the same layer for any two objects, results in crazy drawing when they overlap. No real fix probably possible
    Add zoom function
Scene
    Perhaps make 0 in scene_width/scene_height make the room infinite
    Add a looping toggle to scenes for wrap
    Doesn't handle multiple of the same objects well
GameObject
    Implement animation
        Should be implemented but needs to be tested
    Add get_center function
    Add scale function
    Find some way to not have to scale every frame, uses lots of CPU
        Same with rotate
    Add easy way to store text in objects
    Tint will be infinitely faster if done by creating a colored surface and blitting it to the objects image.
Spritesheet
    Add methods for spacing between sprites, strips that are multiple lines, etc
Implement resource dictionaries
    Sprite/spritesheet functionality implemented
    Need a way to load fonts at the proper size
    Don't render fonts a lot
Update the enginedocs
    Append if active stuff to them
Implement dirty rect animation
    May not be feasible due to abstraction of views/scrolling inherent to engine
Look into possibly using cairo for final drawing
Game
    Make link still able to move while colliding
        Will add a lot to the feel of the game
    Move collision box for water one square down
    Fix animation speeds
    Maybe make two different collision arrays so I'm not always switching and reloading them multiple times/frame

    Handle collisions for grass and stuff that doesn't involve player in main, not in player code
    Potentially change engine from handling positions internally in objects instead of externally in the scene
